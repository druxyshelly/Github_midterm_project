        <p>Winter is the best season out of all four since it's somewhat straight out of a storybook: the gentle, falling snow is a magical sight to see, and even more so if you live in a place where auroras are a common occurrence. </p>
        
        <p>Though the weather may get harsh at times, I feel that the stillness and tranquility that Winter offers is truly soothing: it makes you take a step back, take it slow, and appreciate the fullness of your being. I love Winter not just because of Christmas, but also because Winter is that time of the year when we get to reassess our lives, our goals, and our families. I dread Summer because of the heat: whereas during Winter, you can get away with looking like a walking blanket, Summer strips away that layer of comfort, and makes me carry around a fan and a handkerchief.</p>
