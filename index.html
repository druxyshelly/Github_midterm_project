                <p class="grid-item">Winter is better than summer because the Christmas holidays are during
                    this season. You can spend quality time with family and/or friends, stay home and do fun activities
                    such as baking cookies, decorating gingerbread houses, and watching TV shows or movies.
                </p>

                <p class="grid-item">During winter, it also snows a lot which looks beautiful and makes it possible to partake
                    in several outdoor activities such as skating, building a snowman, snowboarding, skiing.
                </p>

                <p class="grid-item">Last but not least, the seasonal drinks for winter are also delicious. It's the perfect
                    time of the year to drink mochas, hot cocoa, egg nog, hot apple cider with cinnamon, and so on.
