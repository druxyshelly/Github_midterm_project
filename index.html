    <h1>WINTER VS SUMMER</h1> 

    <h2>Reasons why summer is better than winter</h2>

    <h3>Comfort</h3>

       <p>In many locations across the globe, there is a point where the summer heat is unbearable and the winter cold is unrelenting.<br>Removing those outliers, I much prefer the looseness and freedom of summer.<br> I'm more comfortable in shorts than a coat and, as someone who likes to stay active, it's overall easier to function.<br> Winter gear is meant as a defensive mechanism, so you can't move much while wearing it.<br> Also, your muscles are always tight in cold weather while the summer actually helps your body's flexibility.</p><br>
   
    <h3>Beauty</h3>

       <p>Life is better in color and the summer sun is the world's best illuminator. There is so much to see in life, in nature and beyond, so why would you want it covered up?<br>The flowers from spring are in full bloom, lakes sparkle from the bright sky and the daylight lasts much longer. And it's widely proven that sunlight is good for your emotions.</p><br>
    
    <h3>What to do</h3>

       <p>Roads are safe to drive on and paths aren't hazardous to pedestrians, so you won't be limited by the elements, leaving you plenty of entertainment options. Spend a day on the beach, take a hike through the mountains, bike through the park, etc. Most snowy attractions are contingent on temperatures and you always have to check the conditions. For most of what you want to do in summer, you don't have these restrictions.</p><br>

    <h3>Vacationing</h3>

       <p>Summer vacation is the longest of all the breaks/holidays, which makes it the most significant season for travelers. It's the only chance during the year where you can lose yourself and still have time to find yourself. There is nothing you can't do road trip, Caribbean cruise, month-long getaway, etc. This is peak season for a reason. You're supposed to travel in the summer.</p><br>
    <h3>Food</h3>

       <p>What's more satisfying: hot chocolate in front of the fireplace after a long day playing in the snow or an icy glass of lemonade after running around in 90-plus degree temperatures? I'm choosing lemonade every time.</p><br>
    <h3>The air</h3>
       <img src="img/w.jpeg" alt="Nice" width="500"/>
       <p> You'll encounter so many aromas floating around that you can really engage with the nature around you. There is just something about a salty ocean breeze or fresh cut grass that only the warm months can provide. On the other hand, the winter air can be brutal. Sucking down wind sends pain down your throat and it dehydrates you just as fast as sweating does. The only difference is that you don't sweat in the cold, giving you a false sense of security.</p><br>
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

       <p>The winter has a lot to offer, but with its unpredictability and dependence on the right conditions, I'd much prefer to save my travel time for the warm months. Plus, even Olaf prefers summer.</p><br>
